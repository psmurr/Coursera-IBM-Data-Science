Hello! Welcome to my portfolio repository!

This is where I keep a selection of my research projects, writing and coding samples, and presentations.
Coding is primarily done in Python, SQL, and R. SPSS, Stata, and SAS are also used for some statistical outputs.

I can always be reached at gr4507@wayne.edu

Thanks for looking!
